## 📋 Description

This dataset is designed for machine learning and deep learning tasks related to head gesture classification. Each gesture sequence is captured as **60 image frames**, recorded at a **framerate of 20 FPS** (i.e., covering approximately 3 seconds per gesture).

## 🏷️ Class Details

The dataset consists of six classes, each representing a different head gesture or detection state:

| Label           | Description                                                               |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Kiri**         | Head shakes twice to the **left**.                                        |
| **Kanan**        | Head shakes twice to the **right**.                                       |
| **Maju**         | Head nods **upward twice** (looking up).                                  |
| **Mundur/Stop**  | Head tilts **backward** or represents a stop signal.                      |
| **Normal**       | Head in **natural or idle position** without specific gestures.           |
| **Nan**          | **Pose not detected**; keypoints missing or undetected by the tracker.    |
